# Code for "Improved Mortality Analysis in Early-Phase Dose-Ranging Clinical Trials for Emergency Medical Diseases Using Bayesian Time-to-Event Models With Active Comparators"

This paper incorporated an active comparator into three statistical models (two-group, EMAX, and hierarchical EMAX models) to measure different dose-response relationships regarding a time-to-event endpoint. The studyâ€™s design was motivated by the need to analyze the mortality outcomes of the HOBIT trial.

- **Simulated_Data.csv**: Contains simulated data.
- **TTE_AC.R**: Includes code for implementing the seven TTE models described in the paper.
